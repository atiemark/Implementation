Title: (Real-time) Sound Synthesis Framework for 3D Surfaces
Students: Markus Artelsmair
Advisor: Volker Christian

Abstract
The goal of this thesis and the final project is a fully functional sound-synthesis application for strings, membranes and possibly arbitrary 3D objects. 
The functionality of the application should include customizeable material parameters and WAVE file output. Additionally, real time synthesis should be the final goal. 
At the current state of the project, there are still some problems that prevent accurate synthesis in real time.
The thesis and project builds on previous work by J. O'Brien, N. Raghuvanshi and others that describes how to use Modal Analysis for interactive Sound Synthesis.
